## Puzzle

The neighborhood sandwich store makes the best sandwiches! They’ve got everything from classics like BLTs to more unusual options like Fluffernutters. Since many of their specialty ingredients keep going bad, they've decided to cut their selection and only focus on their best-selling sandwich. 

To help with the decision, the storeowners have collected data on their customers’ favorite sandwiches. Most people listed several varieties (in no particular order). Here’s a sample of the data:

```{r warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sw <- tibble::tribble(
          ~names, ~sandwiches,
          "Abby", "Denver; BLT; Torta ahogada; Barbecue",
       "Abigail", "BLT; Ftira; Primanti; Ice cream; Choripán",
          "Adam", "Corned beef; Montadito; Cheesesteak; Tripleta; Dagwood; Jambon-beurre",
         "Alexa", "Dagwood; Mortadella",
    "Alexandria", "Slider; Beschuit met muisjes; Chicken salad",
           "Ana", "Fried brain; Polish boy; Vegetable; Pudgy Pie; Dagwood"
    )

sw %>% knitr::kable()
```

In this sample, the Dagwood sandwich is the most popular. 

In the full dataset, **what is the most popular sandwich among the customers?**

## Solution

Let's take a look at the file in R. Note that there are a few non-English letters that could give you some trouble depending on how you import the data into R. Sometimes the letters get "translated" into a mix of letters and punctuation (i.e. "ChoripÃ¡n" rather than "Choripán").

```{r}
sw
```

As first step, let's separate out the sandwiches into individual observations using the handy `tidyr` function, `separate_rows()`. 

```{r}
sw %>% 
    separate_rows(sandwiches, sep = "; ") 
```

Keep in mind that omitting the space in the separator may cause some of the results not to match up. For example, "BLT" and " BLT" would require an extra cleaning step, such as `mutate(sandwiches = str_trim(sandwiches))`.

Next, we can count the sandwiches to determine which type is the most popular. Adding `sort = TRUE` brings the most popular sandwich to the top of the tibble.

```{r}
sw %>% 
    separate_rows(sandwiches, sep = "; ") %>% 
    count(sandwiches, sort = TRUE)
```

That's it! With this small sample, you've got the basics of a working wrangling script that you can try out on the full data.
